POSA-14
=======

This repository contains assignments and examples for the 2014 offering of the POSA MOOC (see www.coursera.org/course/posa for more information) stripped from Eclipse dependencies and converted into something more IDE neutral like Maven.

## Build instructions

Whenever project uses Maven (pom.xml file exists in project directory) simply invoke:

	$ mvn -q package

from directory containing pom.xml file (provided that you have Maven installed).
